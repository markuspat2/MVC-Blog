    <p class="regTxt">Hi! I'm Mark. I am a hard working, creative, problem solver.</p>

	<p class="regTxt">I left my hometown of St. Charles, Mo seven years ago in search of adverture on the high seas. The Navy taught me how to use my creative talent to tell stories with words and images. I served five years as a photojournalist working side by side with a small public affairs team aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6).</p>

	<p class="regTxt">Together my team and I were deployed multiple times. There was never a dull day. As a photojournalist it was my duty to document the daily activities of the crew. Photography became my passion and I learned quickly how to manipulate the light in any situation to my favor.</p>

	<p class="regTxt">As much as I loved photography it wasn't long before I was searching for something more to fill my time at work. (there is A LOT of down time in the Navy) By chance my Command was in search of a new web designer. I quickly jumped on the opportunity although I knew nothing about html or css. I didn't let that stop me. I taught myself html, dreamweaver and FTP pro and within a few months I began planning a full site redesign. </p>
    
    <p class="regTxt">It took me over three months and it was far from perfect but it was live. I'll never forget the response I got from it either. I recieved thank you emails from friends and family of the crew for weeks afterward. They loved the feeling that my site gave them. The photo galleries I had created made them feel closer to their loved ones and for that they could not thank me enough. From then on I was hooked.</p>
    
    <p class="regTxt">Now, I am a web design student. I love my work and I wouldn't trade that for anything else in the world.</p>
